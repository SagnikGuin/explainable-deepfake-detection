## Trained Models

This directory contains trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models saved
in `.h5` format, used for deepfake detection on the Celeb-DFv2 dataset.

These models were trained as part of this project and can be loaded directly for
inference or evaluation.

The complete model architecture, training procedure, and experimental details
are documented in the `Model_training.ipynb` notebook located in the `notebooks/`
directory.
